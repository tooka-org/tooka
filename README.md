A fast, rule-based CLI tool for organizing files.

## 🧭 Introduction

**Tooka** is a flexible command-line tool for automating your filesystem: organize, rename, move, copy, or delete files using simple, powerful YAML rules.

You define what files to match (by name, extension, metadata, size, etc.) and what should happen to them — Tooka handles the rest with blazing-fast parallel processing.
