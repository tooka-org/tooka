## Development Setup

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- [arguments]
   ```

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. **Run linter:**
   ```bash
   cargo clippy --all-features
   ```

5. **Format code:**
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles

- Write clear, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Rust Conventions

- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Ensure `cargo clippy` passes without warnings
- Write comprehensive tests for new features
- Document public APIs with doc comments

### Testing

- All new features should include tests
- Ensure all tests pass: `cargo test`
- Add tests to the appropriate test module
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide additional context in the body if needed

Example:
```
Add support for custom date formats

- Implement date format parsing in utils
- Update rule matching to support custom formats
- Add tests for various date format patterns
```
